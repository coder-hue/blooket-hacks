### How To Use
Use this bookmarklet(https://www.howtogeek.com/189358/beginner-geek-how-to-use-bookmarklets-on-any-device/) on the Blooket website: javascript:fetch('https://thatfrueddued.github.io/blooket-hack/index.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(t=>(new Function(t))())

How do I make a bookmarklet? Copy-paste the above code into the URL field of a bookmark in your web browser. Then, once on the Blooket page, click the bookmark.

Once you see the interface after you click the bookmarklet, toggle your desired options via the interface. Once you are done customizing, press "Launch Hack". This will open a new tab. Wait for this new tab to completely load (it will flash white once), then play Blooket as you would.
